Currently looking into pipelines

RE: report
  pipelines are something I can implement later. For now, I'll fill out the pages I believe to be critical.

Actual New York Times Site Includes:
* Article headlines
* Links to full articles
* Navigation bar
* "Today's paper" link
  * A paper is comprised of:
    * Front page with top stories
    * Articles
      * paragraphs -(check)
      * title -(check)
      * date -(check)
      * author -(check)
      * occasional picture
      * author link
      * links to talk about article on social medias (like the hashtag on twitter)
      * occasional video
      * videos and pictures have blurbs about them
      * separated into story sections with sub titles
