## Description

This project is an attempt at replicating a popular site utilizing several development tools that I would like to practice with. The NYT newspaper site is in no way affiliated with Myself or Epicodus (the educational company I am a student at).

On this site a user should be able to view articles. Articles will be written by authors (also viewable) and articles should be able to be commented on. One should be able to view articles in a given news section - such as 'World News' - and even subsections of that - such as 'Africa'. Another feature of the NYT site is the ability to view any given day's paper: a paper consisting of all articles published on a given day.

## Setup and Installation
